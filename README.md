cspace_postgresql_server
========================

 A Puppet module to:
 * Ensure that an instance of PostgreSQL 9.x server exists. 
 * Configure PostgreSQL for use by CollectionSpace.

**Please make changes on the appropriate branch for the CollectionSpace
version to be installed**: e.g. `v4.2`, `v4.1`. And create new branches
for new CollectionSpace versions. (The `master` branch is now deprecated.)
